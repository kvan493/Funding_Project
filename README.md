# Funding_Project
The purpose of this project is to build 2 models to predict whether an organization will receive funding where one includes text analysis of the descriptive title and the 
other does not. This challenge is to determine whether the descriptive title of each organization will improve the model's prediction in whether funding is received or not. This 
project was assigned by The DevMasters. 

To compare the two classification-based models, all parameters were consistent with the exception of one model that included the vectorized features from text analysis. A few 
algorithms were used to test the model: Decision Tree Classifier, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Classifier and Random Forest Classifier. For both models, Decision Tree
Classifier yielded the best results. However, the model that included text analysis did not improve the predictions.
